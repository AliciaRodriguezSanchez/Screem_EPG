Install aplication:
  
    1. In the root folder of ployect =>  npm install.
    2. In the folder of client (cd /client) => npm install
    
    in this point the proyect is install , now you can execute in the root folder :
    
    npm run dev

    In this step, two ports will be opened:
        - Front port: 3000
        - Back port 1337

    I have done some small test these can be seen by launching:
        folder of /client : npm run test
